The main skills acquired with this project were:

* Configure a deployment environment to manage the lifecycle of an application
* Correct malfunctions reported by the customer on the application
* Produce technical and functional documentation of the application
* Complete a suite of unit and integration tests to take into account the changes made
* Provide customer-requested feature enhancements
